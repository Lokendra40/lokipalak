        <h2>🚕 First Date Cab Story - Chandni Chowk</h2>
        <p>
          This memory always hits my heart the hardest. On our first date, we were going to Chandni Chowk in the back seat of a cab.
          You were tired after college, and then suddenly you came closer and slept on my shoulder. In that moment my heart started
          beating so fast and I was just thinking, "what is happening right now?" It felt unreal and perfect at the same time. While
          you were sleeping on my shoulder, I clicked that photo. Even now, whenever I see that same photo, I feel the same thing again:
          fast heartbeat, warm chest, and that peaceful feeling that I want this moment to never end.

        <h2>💙 3 January - Blue Poshak Story</h2>
        <p>
          This is my complete second best memory, exactly how I feel it in my heart. On 3 January, you tried a poshak and sent me your
          snap at exactly 2:37 PM. A few days before that, I had told you that I really like girls who wear poshak, and when you sent
          that snap it felt so personal and so special to me, like you remembered that one line and made my day on purpose. At that time
          I was busy and could not check immediately, and I kept thinking maybe you were excited and could not wait, because at 4:13 PM
          you called me and said, "check the snap." The moment I opened it and saw you in that blue poshak, everything changed inside me.
          My heart started beating so fast, then it felt like it was melting at the same time, and I just sat there staring at you. I
          stopped my work, forgot everything else, and kept seeing that same snap again and again because I could not move on from how
          beautiful you looked and how deeply I felt it. Before this day, I used to think you are a very good girl and I liked you a lot,
          but after this moment I started falling in love with you for real. It was that butterfly feeling in my chest, that soft panic,
          that smile I could not control, and that thought in my mind that maybe this is the girl I was waiting for. Even now, whenever I
          miss you, I open that same snap and all the same feelings come back: fast heartbeat, warm chest, big smile, and the exact
          feeling that my heart chose you that day.

        <h2>📱 Number Exchange Night</h2>
        <p>
          31 December, 11:13 PM on Snapchat. That was the night we exchanged numbers. I was at a New Year party, and even in all that
          noise, your message felt like the only important thing. That one moment made the night special for me, because it felt like we
          moved from random chats to something real.
