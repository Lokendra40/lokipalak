        <p>
          This memory always hits my heart the hardest. On our first date, we were going to Chandni Chowk in the back seat of a cab.
          You were tired after college, and then suddenly you came closer and slept on my shoulder. In that moment my heart started
          beating so fast and I was just thinking, "what is happening right now?" It felt unreal and perfect at the same time. While
          you were sleeping on my shoulder, I clicked that photo. When you slept on my shoulder, I could smell the fragrance of your hair,
          and it was so good. I held your hand with fingers intertwined, and it felt like you were completely mine. I kissed your forehead,
          and I was matching my breathing with yours so your sleep would not be disturbed. At that time I just wanted that cab to never stop,
          and we keep moving without a stop. The moment was so good. When hair came on your face, I moved it back near your ear, and I kept
          rubbing my hand softly on your face. It was a great and cute moment for me.
