        <p>
          This is my complete second best memory, exactly how I feel it in my heart. On 3 January, you tried a poshak and sent me your
          snap at exactly 2:37 PM. A few days before that, I had told you that I really like girls who wear poshak, and when you sent
          that snap it felt so personal and so special to me, like you remembered that one line and made my day on purpose. At that time
          I was busy and could not check immediately, and I kept thinking maybe you were excited and could not wait, because at 4:13 PM
          you called me and said, "check the snap." The moment I opened it and saw you in that blue poshak, everything changed inside me.
          My heart started beating so fast, then it felt like it was melting at the same time, and I just sat there staring at you. I
          stopped my work, forgot everything else, and kept seeing that same snap again and again because I could not move on from how
          beautiful you looked and how deeply I felt it. Before this day, I used to think you are a very good girl and I liked you a lot,
          but after this moment I started falling in love with you for real. It was that butterfly feeling in my chest, that soft panic,
          that smile I could not control, and that thought in my mind that maybe this is the girl I was waiting for. Even now, whenever I
          miss you, I open that same snap and all the same feelings come back: fast heartbeat, warm chest, big smile, and the exact
          feeling that my heart chose you that day.
